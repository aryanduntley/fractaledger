# FractaLedger Custom Chaincodes

This directory contains custom chaincodes created from templates. These chaincodes can be customized and deployed to the Hyperledger Fabric network.

## Creating a Custom Chaincode

You can create a custom chaincode from a template using the API:

```
POST /api/chaincode/custom
{
  "templateId": "default",
  "customId": "my-custom-chaincode"
}
```

This will create a new custom chaincode in this directory based on the specified template.

## Customizing a Chaincode

You can customize a chaincode by modifying its files. The main file to modify is `index.js`, which contains the chaincode logic.

To update a file in a custom chaincode, use the API:

```
PUT /api/chaincode/custom/:id
{
  "filePath": "index.js",
  "content": "// Your updated chaincode content"
}
```

## Deploying a Chaincode

Before deploying a chaincode, you should install its dependencies:

```
POST /api/chaincode/custom/:id/install-dependencies
```

Then, you can deploy the chaincode to the Hyperledger Fabric network:

```
POST /api/chaincode/custom/:id/deploy
```

## Updating a Deployed Chaincode

If you've made changes to a deployed chaincode, you can update it:

```
POST /api/chaincode/custom/:id/update
```

## Deleting a Custom Chaincode

To delete a custom chaincode, use the API:

```
DELETE /api/chaincode/custom/:id
```

## Best Practices

1. **Test thoroughly**: Test your custom chaincode thoroughly before deploying it to the production network.
2. **Version control**: Keep track of changes to your custom chaincodes using version control.
3. **Documentation**: Document your custom chaincode's functionality and any modifications you've made.
4. **Error handling**: Implement proper error handling in your chaincode to ensure it behaves correctly in all scenarios.
5. **Security**: Be careful when modifying chaincode that handles sensitive operations like fund transfers.
