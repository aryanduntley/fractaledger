  <h2>Future Improvements</h2>
  
  <p>
    While the current implementation of package exports and TypeScript support provides a solid foundation, there are several areas where we plan to make further improvements in future releases.
  </p>

  <h3>Convert More Files to TypeScript</h3>

  <p>
    Currently, we've added TypeScript definition files (.d.ts) to provide type information for our JavaScript code. In the future, we plan to gradually convert more JavaScript files to TypeScript (.ts) to improve type safety and documentation.
  </p>

  <p>
    Converting to TypeScript will provide several benefits:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Better type checking during development</li>
    <li>Improved IDE support with inline type information</li>
    <li>More accurate documentation through TypeScript's rich type system</li>
    <li>Potential to catch bugs earlier in the development process</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This conversion will be done incrementally, starting with core modules and gradually expanding to the entire codebase.
  </p>

  <h3>Add More TypeScript Tests</h3>

  <p>
    We've added initial TypeScript tests to verify the type definitions for the blockchain module. In the future, we plan to add more TypeScript tests to verify the type definitions for all modules, ensuring that our TypeScript definitions accurately reflect the actual behavior of the code.
  </p>

  <p>
    These tests will help us:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Verify that our TypeScript definitions are correct</li>
    <li>Catch type errors early in the development process</li>
    <li>Ensure that our TypeScript definitions remain in sync with the code as it evolves</li>
    <li>Provide examples of how to use the TypeScript definitions</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Improve ES Modules Support</h3>

  <p>
    While we've added support for ES Modules alongside CommonJS, there's still room for improvement in this area. In the future, we plan to:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Convert more code to use ES Modules syntax natively</li>
    <li>Improve the build process to better handle ES Modules</li>
    <li>Add more tests for ES Modules usage</li>
    <li>Provide better documentation for ES Modules users</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    These improvements will make it easier for users to use FractaLedger in modern JavaScript environments that support ES Modules.
  </p>

  <h3>Enhance Package Exports Configuration</h3>

  <p>
    We plan to enhance the package exports configuration to provide more granular control over what parts of the package are accessible to users. This may include:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Adding more subpaths for specific functionality</li>
    <li>Providing conditional exports for different environments (browser, Node.js, etc.)</li>
    <li>Adding support for importing specific components directly</li>
    <li>Improving the organization of the exports to make it more intuitive for users</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Improve Documentation</h3>

  <p>
    We'll continue to improve the documentation for package exports and TypeScript support, including:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>More examples of how to use the package exports in different scenarios</li>
    <li>Better explanations of the TypeScript type system and how it applies to FractaLedger</li>
    <li>More detailed API documentation with TypeScript type information</li>
    <li>Guides for migrating from older versions of FractaLedger to the new package exports system</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Feedback and Contributions</h3>

  <p>
    We welcome feedback and contributions from the community to help improve the package exports and TypeScript support in FractaLedger. If you have suggestions, bug reports, or would like to contribute code, please:
